# Auction House
This is a Spring based auction house web app. It demonstrates the basic CRUD operations using frameworks and other tools that I believe to be useful to learn.

I'm using **Spring Boot** for quick setup, an MVC model for the whole application.

I also use **MySQL** for the database, and **Hibernate** to access it more easily.

The view part is displayed with **Thymeleaf** templating engine.
